make copy of congf in cassanrdra dir as conf2 and conf3
change cassandra.yaml of all
change casssandra-env of all
make 2 copies of cassadra.in.sh as cassanra2.in and casandra3.in and edit correspoding conf location
make 2 copies of cassadra as cassanra2 and casandra3 and edit corresponding paths



Install cassandra on the system

In Linux : // important before making changes in .yaml file
systemctl stop cassandra
rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/*  # To remove the default data present in the cassandra


open cassandra.yaml file in CONF folder of its home dir (/etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml).
Edit following properties:
cluster_name:	Choose your cluster name here.
seed_provider:	This contains a comma-delimited list of each public IP address of each node to be clustered. Input the list in the line that reads - seeds: "127.0.0.1".
listen_address:	Other nodes in the cluster will use the IP address listed here to find each other. Change from localhost to the specific node’s public IP address.
rpc_address:	The listen address for client communication. Change from “localhost” to the public IP address or loopback address of the node.
endpoint_snitch:	Snitches determine how Cassandra replicates data. Change this to “GossipingPropertyFileSnitch,” as this is more suitable to a multi-data center configuration.
auto_bootstrap:	Add this property anywhere in the file. If you have yet to add data to your nodes - that is, you would start with a fresh cluster - set this to “false.” If your node(s) already contains data, do not add this property.
num_tokens:	This property defines the proportion of data stored on each node. For nodes with equal hardware capabilities, this number should be set equally between them so the data is more likely to be evenly distributed. The default value of 256 is likely to ensure equal data distribution.
    /etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml
    cluster_name: '[Your Cluster Name]'       // do not change cluster name directly. follow steps below to change the name 
    listen_address: [public_ip_address]      //This is IP address that other nodes in the cluster will use to connect to this one. It defaults to localhost and needs changed to the IP address of the node.
    rpc_address: [public_ip_address] //This is the IP address for remote procedure calls. It defaults to localhost. If the server’s hostname is properly configured, leave this as is. Otherwise, change to server’s IP address or the loopback address (127.0.0.1).
    num_tokens: 256
    seed_provider:
    - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
        parameters:
        - seeds: "[node1_ip_address],[node2_ip_address]"    // set seed node address to the ip of servers which you want to make changes through
    endpoint_snitch: GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
    auto_bootstrap: false

Edit the cassandra-rackdc.properties file. Assign each node the same data center and rack name
    /etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties
    # These properties are used with GossipingPropertyFileSnitch and will
    # indicate the rack and dc for this node
    dc=DC1
    rack=RACK1

Open Cassandra Communication Ports: Ports 7000 and 9042 must be available 
for ubuntu : ufw allow proto tcp from [external_node_ip_address] to any port 7000,9042 comment "Cassandra TCP"

Start cassandra:
systemctl start cassandra

To see each node in your cluster:
Run "$nodetool status" 

Starting CQlSH:
$ cqlsh <server_ip_addr> <port>
$ cqlsh 13.233.155.12 9042

* change the name of the cluster:
cqlsh> UPDATE system.local SET cluster_name = 'Cassendra Cluster' where key='local';
cqlsh> exit;
$ nodetool flush system
$ sudo systemctl stop cassandra
$ sudo vi /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
cluster_name: 'Cassendra Cluster'
$ sudo systemctl start cassandra

Check Installation Log:
 $ cat /var/log/cassandra/output.log

Change the ip and port for nodetool command:
nodetool -h 127.0.0.2 -p 7188
